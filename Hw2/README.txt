Instructions to run and compile the code:
1. Same headers as given in the problems are used. Just need to pass the input files and additional parameters.
2. Two different graphs are drawn for logistic regression and naive bayes.
3. Datasets of any size (number of training datapoints or sizes of mini batches, dimensionality of features) can be given as input, the code will scale accordingly.
4. Both the codes would run for 2 class datasets. Both codes assume the classes to be labeled as 1 and 3.
